Are you interested in transport models and simulations, in particular MATSim?

Would you like to take care that active mobility (cycling and walking) can be better and more realistically captured in large-scale transport simulation?

Are you confident in processing mobility data and programing, and would you like to do a PhD in agent-based modeling of cycling and walking?

Then please have a look at our new [**Researcher/PhD position**](https://jobs.dlr.de/default/job/Verkehrsmodelliererin-%28wmd%29-Simulation-aktiver-Mobilit%C3%A4t-%28Fahrrad-und-Fu%C3%9Fverkehr%29/2747-de_DE)
