If you are interested to learn MATSim, the team of the TU Berlin published the latest MATSim tutorial!
The tutorial provides a step-by-step installation and usage guide for creating your own scenario and policy cases.
It does not always go too much into detail (as it is usually taught in a very responsive way in a classroom), so if you need more details about a certain topic, please also consult the [MATSim book](/the-book) and [MATSim user guide](/docs/userguide).

Additionally, the course contains recorded videos of the lecture and the seminars.
