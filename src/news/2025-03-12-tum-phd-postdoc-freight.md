SEE-FAr is a joint project between the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and DFG
(German Research Foundation) which aims to evaluate the complex impact of
freight vehicles automation and electrification distinguishing the charging
options between e-roads and plug-in to promote decarbonized and cost
efficient freight transportation in Austria and Bavaria.

At least the DFG part will heavily depend on MATSim.

This project involves a close collaboration between DAVeMoS, BOKU
University, Austria, and Transportation System Engineering (TSE) chair of
the Technical University Munich, Germany.
The project is expected to start in May 2025.
The employment starting date is negotiable.
