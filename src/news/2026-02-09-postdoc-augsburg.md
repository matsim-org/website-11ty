At the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Augsburg, at the Chair of Model-based Environmental Exposure Sciences (MBEES), a position is available from 1 August 2026 at the earliest, for a Postdoctoral Researcher (m/f/d)
to be filled at 100% of the regular working hours in a fixed-term appointment for one year. Remuneration will be in accordance with pay grade E13 TV-L, subject to the fulfillment of personal and collective bargaining requirements.

The advertised position is embedded in the EU Horizon project PUREPOLIS. PUREPOLIS is an ambitious European research project aiming to improve urban health through the development of advanced, data-driven, and participatory tools. Multiple environmental exposures (air, noise, water, soil) are linked to health risks in order to optimize zero-pollution strategies for cities. To this end, PUREPOLIS integrates real-time monitoring, health impact assessments, digital twins, and dynamic policy tools. The project involves 19 partners from 9 European countries, with MBEES being one of the project partners.

Your Responsibilities:

- Establishment and application of an agent-based model (e.g., MATSim or an in-house Python implementation) to represent the daily activities of the entire population in the project case studies Nantes (France) and Valencia (Spain)
- Calculation of population-based environmental exposures to air pollutants and noise based on agent-based modeling
- Collaboration with epidemiology partners to estimate population-wide health burdens
- Integration of the agent-based model into a dynamic intervention and scenario assessment tool to evaluate mitigation strategies for policy and administrative decision-makers
- Active participation in a large European collaborative research project with regular scientific exchange
- Participation in project meetings and presentation of results at national and international conferences
- Publication of research results in international, peer-reviewed scientific journals
