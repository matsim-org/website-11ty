The Chair of Infrastructure Management, led by Professor Dr. Bryan T. Adey, in the Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management 
of the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering has an opening for a PhD student in model-based planning support for 
transport and urban systems under uncertainty.

The goal of this doctorate is to advance the state-of-the-art of model-based planning support for transport and urban systems under uncertainty. 
The doctorate will develop new tools and methods that integrate large-scale agent-based modelling, surrogate modelling, scenario planning, and 
sequential decision analytics. The research conducted during the doctorate will improve the long-term planning of urban and transport systems 
in Switzerland in close collaboration with the Center for Sustainable Future Mobility (CSFM) and the Chair of Risk, Safety, and Uncertainty Quantification at ETH ZÃ¼rich. 
The main contributions of this research will be: 1) integrate both qualitative foresight scenario planning and quantitative scenario simulation workflows; 
2) develop new spatially explicit surrogate models that enable the use of large-scale agent-based models for the simulation of a wide range of future scenarios, and 
3) advance the use of sequential decision analytics (e.g., reinforcement learning or stochastic optimisation) to identify optimal adaptive plans.
