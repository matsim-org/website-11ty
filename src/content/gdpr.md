## Data Protection & Privacy (GDPR)

The MATSim Association is committed to protecting your personal data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable Swiss data protection law.

### Purpose of data processing

We process personal data submitted via the membership signup form exclusively for the following purposes:

- administration of MATSim Association memberships,
- invoicing and membership fee collection,
- communication related to membership benefits, governance, and events,
- compliance with statutory accounting and legal obligations.

### Data storage and access

Membership and administrative data is stored in a secure **Google Firestore document database hosted in Europe**.

Access to this data is **strictly limited to authorized MATSim Association management** and protected by role-based access controls and authentication.

The MATSim Association does not sell personal data.

### Online payments (Payrexx)

If you select **Online Payment**, the payment transaction is processed directly by **Payrexx AG** as an independent payment service provider.

- The MATSim Association does **not** receive or store payment card details or other sensitive payment credentials.
- Payrexx processes payment-related personal data under its **own responsibility** and in accordance with its **own data protection, security, and regulatory compliance obligations**.

### Data retention

Personal data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes stated above.

Certain records (e.g. invoices and payment records) must be retained for statutory accounting and tax obligations and therefore cannot always be deleted immediately upon request.

### Your rights

You have the right to:

- request access to your personal data,
- request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data,
- request deletion of your personal data, where legally permissible,
- withdraw consent for non-essential processing.

Requests can be submitted at any time by contacting **info@matsim.org**.
