FOR MEMBERS: Please make sure to follow instructions carefully on the registration page and use the 'INVOICE' option when checking out, as this is a workaround on our payment system which doesn't like zero-priced items.
We don't have a mechanism for refunding payments, so please make sure to use the 'INVOICE' option if you are a member, which will let you complete the process without payment.

Please visit the [hEART 2025 conference website](https://www.heart2025.vtk.ed.tum.de) if you intend to participate in both events. You will need to register separately for hEART and MUM 2025.

**Please be sure to register at least 2 weeks before the event so we can ensure adequate catering and seating arrangements.**
