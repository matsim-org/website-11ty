The following is a list of known scenario data sets that are open and free to use with MATSim. 
Not all data sets contain all required files to run a MATSim model. 
Some may only provide a network for example.

<div class="important-notice">
Please give credit when using these scenarios.

## MATSim-Scenarios on GitHub

There are a number of scenarios available at [github.com/matsim-scenarios](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios).

VSP, TU Berlin provides a number of scenarios covering smaller and larger German regions, e.g. 
[Berlin](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-berlin), 
[Hamburg](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-hamburg), 
[Munich](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-munich), 
[Ruhrgebiet](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-metropole-ruhr), 
[Kelheim](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-kelheim), 
and more.

Besides these, other provided scenarios cover 
[Mexico-City](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-mexico-city),
[Los Angeles](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-los-angeles),
[Santiago](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-santiago),
[Sweden](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-sweden),
[Paris / Île-de-France](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios/matsim-ile-de-france),
and more.


## MATSim-Scenarios from VSP, TU Berlin

Most of the scenarios provided by VSP are now [available on GitHub](https://github.com/matsim-scenarios).
Some older open source scenarios are still in the 
[SVN directory](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/) as follows. 
The directories are hierarchically organized and should be self-explanatory. 
VSP tries to provide readme files, but this does not always work:


## South Africa

Prof. Johan Joubert (at that time from the University of Pretoria, now KU Leuven) has 
[open sourced some of the scenarios](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-code-examples/wiki/south-africa) he built, each consisting of a network and a population.


## Île-de-France (Paris), France

An open and reproducible simulation scenario for Île-de-France is available [here](/gallery/ile_de_france).

## Vienna, Austria

The Austrian Institute of Technology AIT has open-sourced their model of [Vienna, Austria](https://github.com/ait-energy/matsim-model-vienna).


## MATSim Test Examples

Some smaller scenarios are directly contained in the MATSim source repository, 
often used for feature demonstration or tests:

## Other links to open data

(just a list of links we've come across)

A registry of public transit data: <http://transit.land> .

German public transport:

- [Mobilithek](http://mobilithek.info), open data portal for all kinds of transport-related data from Germany.
- [gtfs.de](https://gtfs.de), public transport schedules in GTFS format for Germany.
