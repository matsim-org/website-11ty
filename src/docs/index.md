## User Guide

The [MATSim user guide](/files/book/partOne-latest.pdf) (PDF) is an extract and update of the [MATSim book](/the-book). 

The user guide chapters contain the most relevant topics for new users.

The user guide is typically updated along with the MATSim class that we teach at TU Berlin every year between April and July.

## [The Book](/the-book)

The ["MATSim Book"](/the-book) is now the authoritative reference.

There is an extract of the first couple of chapters, which contains the [most relevant topics for new users](/docs/userguide). This is also referred to as the ["MATSim user guide"](/docs/userguide).

Some [Terminology](/docs/userguide/terminology) (i.e. correspondences between MATSim terminology and more standard transport modelling terminology, and reasons why ours is different) can be found [here](/docs/userguide/terminology).
